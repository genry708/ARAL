      <h2>Why We Advocate</h2>
      <p>
        Education is a fundamental right, that every child deserves. It 
        provides the foundation for learning, growth, and personal development, opening doors to opportunities
         that help learners reach their full potential. Yet millions of children around the
         world‚Äîespecially those who are in rural and marginalized communities‚Äîare still denied access to quality 
         learning. In the Philippines, many students face overcrowded classrooms, long commutes to schools, and a
          lack of textbooks and facilities. Rural and marginalized communities are often the most affected, with 
          children struggling to keep up due to poverty and limited resources.</p>
      <p>  </p>
      <p id="global">
        Around the world, children face similar challenges in accessing quality education. Ensuring inclusive 
        and equitable learning opportunities globally is essential so that every learner, regardless of where 
        they are, can thrive and achieve their dreams.</p>

    <!-- ================= WHAT'S BEING DONE ================= -->
    <section class="container">
      <h2>Current Education Efforts</h2>
      <p>The Department of Education (DepEd) has introduced the Quality Basic Education Development Plan 2025‚Äì2035,
         a roadmap designed to reform the current education system. This includes revising the national curriculum,
          building 40,000 new classrooms through public‚Äìprivate partnerships, and implementing the ARAL program to
           help struggling learners catch up. Initiatives to improve digital learning, such as the DepEd 
           Computerization Program, are also being rolled out to provide laptops and smart TVs to public schools.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p id="teacher">Teacher training is also being prioritized, with the National Educators Academy 
        of the Philippines (NEAP) and PEAC offering professional development programs. These aim to enhance subject
         mastery, digital skills, and inclusive teaching methods. Such efforts recognize that quality education 
         depends not only on classrooms and textbooks, but also on well-trained, motivated teachers.
      </p>

    <!-- ================= WHERE ARAL COMES IN ================= -->
    <section class="container">
      <h2>ARAL in Action</h2>
      <p>This is where ARAL steps in. As an advocacy group, we focus on bridging the gap for underserved learners
         by providing localized learning materials, organizing mentorship programs, and pushing for policy reforms
          that prioritize equitable access. Our mission is simple: to ensure that every child, regardless of 
          background, has the opportunity to learn, grow, and achieve their dreams.
